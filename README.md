- Don't compare yourself to others
- Focus on consistency, not perfection

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. Tutorial hell - balance learning with building
2. Skipping basics - master fundamentals first
3. Not practicing enough - coding is a skill, not just knowledge
4. Perfectionism - done is better than perfect
5. Not asking for help - saves time and frustration
6. Inconsistent practice - daily practice beats weekend marathons

### Remember
- **You don't need to know everything** - you need to know how to learn
- **Employers value projects** - show what you can build
- **Consistency beats intensity** - daily progress compounds
- **It's okay to struggle** - that's how you learn
- **Your previous experience matters** - bring your unique perspective
